# DSNP Announce
## Specification Status

| Version | Status |
---------- | ---------
| 0.1     | Draft |

## Purpose
1. Describe the method to announce [DSNP Messages](/DSNP/Overview) to the blockchain.
1. Provide Solidity code examples (pending final contract)
1. Facilitate use of SDK and locating of on-chain data

## Assumptions
* Chain messages are on Ethereum
* Message data is posted via [Ethereum log events](https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378)
* Signature algorithm is [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1). This allows the use `ecreover`
  to get public keys. A public key also need not be included in a log event for ease of validation.
* content hashes are created via the same [keccak-256 hashing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) used by Ethereum.

## DSNP Announce

### DSNPMessage Event

The DSNPMmessage event is a standard event topic to be used for all DSNP Messages.

```solidity
interface DSNPAnnounce {
    event DSNPMessage(bytes32 indexed dsnpRoute, uint16 dsnpType, bytes[] dsnpData);
}
```

| field | description | type |
|-------|-------------|------|
| dsnpType | Enum from [DSNP Message Types](/DSNP/DSNP-Message-Types) | unit16 |
| dsnpData | Matching serialized data from [DSNP Messages](/DSNP/DSNP-Messages) | bytes |

### DSNP Route Field

The route target is a filter that enables smaller applications to filter the large mass of DSNP Messages down to a smaller dataset.
The route is a 32 byte value, most often the id of the sender, but can also be the id of a message for replies and reactions.

```typescript
const dsnpTopic = keccak256("DSNPMessage(bytes32 indexed dsnpRoute, uint16 dsnpType, bytes");

// Subscribe to users
const usersContent = web3.eth.subscribe('logs', {
    topics: [[dsnpTopic, idOfUser0], [dsnpTopic, idOfUser1]]
}, userContentHandler);

// Get past logs to find replies to a message id
const replies = web3.eth.getPastLogs({
  fromBlock: message.blockNumber,
  topics: [[dsnpTopic, message.dsnpId]]
}, replyReactionHandler);
```

#### Route Field Example: From Address

This is the most common route.
The identity of the sender.
Used for broadcasting messages as well as sending notice of a profile update.
If you want to read messages from this user, look for this route.

#### Route Field Example: Message Id

The id of a message the new message is related to.
Used for replies, reactions, and other message related metadata.
If you want to gather additional messages about a message you are showing, look for this route.

#### Route Field Example: Personal Route Id

Messages that are for a user and their applications only.
Usually contains encrypted data.
Generated by taking the keccak-256 hash of the user's id.


### Event Topic

The event topic for DSNPMessage follows the standard Solidity event name to hash standard.
```
0x98aa3317938b163d794c4cf04dce050dbf5b96a939a7387b4b7c38f3cafcbf06 = keccak-256("DSNPMessage(from,uint16,bytes32)")
```
