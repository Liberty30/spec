## Spec status definitions

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Spec is posted as draft PR. It's open for comment and major changes. |
| Proposed | Ready for formal review. It should be done except for minor changes. |
| Tentative | This is the accepted plan. The spec should not change unless there are blocking issues. |
| Final | This version will not change. Changes require a new spec process and new spec version number. |
